# Cocktail-project
Cocktail project of team6


Cocktail project:

https://seytechschool.github.io/21-7-team1-cocktail-project/index.html#search

We have to make sth similar to this:


1. CSS - styling part, hover, responsive, may be add some animation;
2. JavaScript : 
	- search functionality 
	- buttons on NavBar (like all, ordinary drink, cocktail and etc. adding the addEventListeners);
	- buttons on images and addEventListener that it opens another page with information of drink;
	- button -go back-


I suggest for practice if we have a time may be we can add some additional buttons like put to the basket and collect the fee for payment or sth else

Please could you look through may be I forgot smth and you can add if not please choose which part you would like to do, may be we can make a one meeting in zoom , feel free to write any suggestions which will help us to finish our first team project)))‚úåüèº
